I am a postdoc at University of Fribourg (Switzerland) in Statistical and Computational Evolutionary Biology Group of Daniel Wegmann. I received my PhD in Palaeogenetics Group of Joachim Burger at JGU Mainz (Germany). I have background in population genetics, anthropology and archaeology and I study ancient human societies via ancient DNA obtained from human skeletal remains.
