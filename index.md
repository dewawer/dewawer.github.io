After getting my education in anthropology, archaeology and human genetics at Masaryk University in Brno (2010) and Charles University in Prague (2012), I pursued my PhD at Institute of Anthropology, JGU Mainz, Germany (2016) in ancient genomics of European hunter-gatherers and early farmers. I was then awarded EMBO Longterm Fellowship to join the Computational Population Genetics Lab at University of Fribourg, Switzerland. In my projects there I investigated links between social structure and genetic patterns via novel computational approaches. In 2021 I established the Ancient DNA Research Team at Masaryk University in Brno primarily funded by EXPRO grant FORMOR  and I became a group leader in the Genetic History group in the Department of Archaeogenetics of Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.
